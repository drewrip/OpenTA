A new day has dawned.

You walk your trek towards the large mountain in the East, which towers over the plains in the West.

You stumble upon the rocky beginning of the mountain, making your journey thoroughly more difficult.

Crossing over a small hill of black, dense, igneous rock you notice a speck of blue. Not necessarily a rock. Just blue.
